The APEC.csv is the final dataset. I used API to access the online datasets of World bank, International Monetary Funds, Singapore statistics. The statistics of Taiwan is avaliable at http://statdb.dgbas.gov.tw/pxweb/Dialog/statfile1L.asp?lang=1&strList=L. However, this website did not provide the API. I collected data of Taiwan by 'searching and downloading'.

APEC2020.Rmd includes all codes that I used.

methodologies of my research includes: pooled OLS, interaction, instrumental variable, fixed-effect, random-effect, mixed-effect.

And I tried to solve the problem of missing data by imputation (maximum,minimum,mean)
